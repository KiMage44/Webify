<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>It's a bit of a work in progress at the moment, so please excuse any weird bugs you may find while using it.
<br><br>
I made this site to hone my skills with html and javascript, since, as we all know, one needs experience for even entry
level jobs nowadays. So hopefully, projects like these will count, and verify my capabilites to future employers. Figured 
if I'm gonna type this, I might as well be straight with you all.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, its still hopefully usable, I would like to see some actual benefit come from my labor, so feel free to try the site out!
ideally you'll be able to use it as a redundant spotify player, because using the app is too mainstream, am I right?
At some point I hope to add a feedback button to improve my skills.
